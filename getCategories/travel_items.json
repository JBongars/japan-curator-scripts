In 1590, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the second unifier of Japan, defeated the Hojo clan after three intense months of brutal fighting during the infamous Siege of Odawara and dismantled the castle after deeming it too great a threat to his seat of power in Edo. It was rebuilt and demolished again in the latter half of the 19th century when political power changed from the Edo shogunate to the Meiji government and the castle was condemned as the symbol of samurai.

To balance the skyscraper size of the hotel with its traditional concept, each level of the 14 floors is designed to replicate a single ryokan, complete with its own Ochanoma (tea lounge) area, where staff (in Sou Sou designed uniforms) serve onigiri (rice balls), tea and seasonal sake.\",\"excerpt\":\"\",\"highlights\":\"\",\"est-room-cap\":\"\",\"rooms\":{\"description\":\"\",\"images\":[],\"name\":\"\"}},\"costing\":{\"cost-per-pax\":\"\",\"cost-per-room\":\"\"},\"images\":[],\"amenities\":[{\"icon\":\"mini-mart\",\"name\":\"Mini-mart (5 min)\",\"state\":true},{\"icon\":\"train-station\",\"name\":\"Train Station (5 min)\",\"state\":true},{\"icon\":\"shuttle-svc\",\"name\":\"Shuttle Service\",\"state\":false},{\"icon\":\"room-svc\",\"name\":\"Room Service\",\"state\":true},{\"icon\":\"spa-svc\",\"name\":\"Spa Services\",\"state\":true},{\"icon\":\"pool-in\",\"name\":\"Indoor Pool\",\"state\":false},{\"icon\":\"pool-out\",\"name\":\"Outdoor Pool\",\"state\":false},{\"icon\":\"fitness-ctr\",\"name\":\"Fitness Centre\",\"state\":false},{\"icon\":\"barrier-free\",\"name\":\"Barrier Free\",\"state\":false},{\"icon\":\"nursing-room\",\"name\":\"Nursing Room\",\"state\":false}]}"

After a long period of peace and stability during the Edo Period, Sadajiro decided to use his blacksmithing skills to create more practical gardening scissors for ikebana and bonsai artists, and this led to the birth of Sasuke scissors in 1867.  Sasuke's prized scissors are made of blades comprising two layers of metal - iron and steel - which must be melded together. Each layer of metal is heated to a different temperature, covered with a mixture of borax and rust powder, and finally melded together in a shower of sparks by hitting it with a hammer.
